 *
 * - `Payment` is a sealed superclass that can only be extended by specific
 * classes. 
 * - `CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment` are the only permitted
 * subclasses of `Payment`. 
 * - Any attempt to create additional subclasses of `Payment` outside the 
 * permitted list will result in a compilation error, ensuring a controlled and 
 * secure class hierarchy.
