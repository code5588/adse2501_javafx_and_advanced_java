/**
 * This program demonstrates the usage of the Stack class in Java.
 * Stack is a class that implements a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.
 * It allows adding elements to the top of the stack and removing elements
 * from the top, following the LIFO principle.
 *
 * Methods demonstrated include:
 * - push: To add an element to the top of the stack.
 * - pop: To remove and retrieve the top element of the stack.
 * - peek: To retrieve, without removing, the top element of the stack.
 * - search: To find the position of an element in the stack.
 * - empty: To check if the stack is empty.
